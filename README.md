License Manager is an application created with ASP.NET CORE.
In application you can store your licenses for programs like Microsoft Office, operating systems.
This application was built and tested with the help of technology: ASP.NET Core MVC, EntityFramework, NLog, Xunit, Moq.
I've used some design patterns: Onion pattern for application structure, Domein-driven design and command pattern.
